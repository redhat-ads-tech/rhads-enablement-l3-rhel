Welcome to the Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite Enablement (RHADS) workshop on RHEL. This workshop provides hands-on experience with two critical Red Hat security solutions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux environments that are included in RHADS.

Use of RHTAS and RHTPA on RHEL is generally used in the following situations:

* You wish to ensure the integrity and authenticity of your software artifacts in a pure RHEL environment.
* You wish to integrate RHADS security components (like RHTAS and RHTPA) into your CI/CD pipeline that runs on a non-RHEL or non-OpenShift environment (e.g. xKS) where RHADS is not supported. Your pipelines can be configured to use these components running on RHEL.

== Workshop Overview

This workshop consists of two comprehensive modules designed to help you understand, install, and configure Red Hat's advanced security solutions:

=== Module 1: Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer
Learn how to install and configure Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer on RHEL to ensure the integrity and authenticity of your software artifacts through cryptographic signing and verification.

=== Module 2: Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer  
Learn how to install and configure Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer on RHEL to assess and validate the security posture of your systems and applications.

== Workshop Environment

The workshop environment is pre-configured with:
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10
* Red Hat Build of Keycloak (acting as an OpenID Connect provider)
* Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
* A pre-installed https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started_ee/index.html[Ansible Execution Environment (EE)^] container image with the required Ansible Collections for the products (these can also be downloaded separately and used with a generic execution environment)

The workshop uses a multi-machine architecture where Ansible jobs run from a bastion server to deploy and configure the security components:

* **Bastion Server**: (hostname: `bastion`) Runs Ansible Automation Platform and executes playbooks to install and configure TAS and TPA on target machines
* **TAS Machine**: (hostname: `rhtas`) Dedicated RHEL 10 machine where Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer is installed and configured
* **TPA Machine**: (hostname: `rhtpa`) Dedicated RHEL 10 machine where Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer is installed and configured  
* **Utility Machine**: (hostname: `utility`) Contains Red Hat Build of Keycloak pre-installed and pre-configured as an OpenID Connect provider for authentication and authorization across all components

From the bastion server, you can simply `ssh <hostname>` to access the target machines. These machines are also exposed (on predefined ports) to external traffic.

== Prerequisites

Before starting these exercises for RHEL, ensure you have:

* A modern web browser
* Basic knowledge of Linux command line operations
* `registry.redhat.io` credentials. If you do not have these, please visit the https://access.redhat.com/articles/RegistryAuthentication[Registry Authentication^] article on the Red Hat Customer Portal and create an account. You can also https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/create[create a new or use an existing Registry Service Account^].

=== Optional Reading

The prior lab that works on OpenShift provides foundational knowledge about Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer and Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer, including their capabilities, use cases, and integration points. While not required, completing this optional module will enhance your understanding of the hands-on exercises in this workshop.

== Lab Environment

The terminal window to your right is *already* logged into the lab environment as the `lab-user` user via `ssh`. 
You will use this terminal window to complete most steps of this workshop.

Each module is self-contained and can be completed independently, allowing you to focus on the solutions most relevant to your needs.
