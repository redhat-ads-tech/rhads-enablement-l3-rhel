= Installing and Configuring Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer on RHEL

Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer is a comprehensive solution for signing and verifying software artifacts to ensure their integrity and authenticity. This module will guide you through the installation and configuration process on Red Hat Enterprise Linux using Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

== Overview

The RHTAS service is the downstream redistribution of the https://sigstore.dev/[Sigstore project^].

Although you _could_ independently install and configure the components of RHTAS, Red Hat *strongly* recommends using the supported Ansible collection to ensure you are using the latest version of the products and to leverage the latest features and bug fixes, and configure the many components of RHTAS in a consistent, secure, and repeatable manner. Much like Operators in Kubernetes, Ansible Automation provides an easy way to both install and do ongoing management of RHTAS. It can also be used in production environments using the same process you'll go through in this workshop.

The automation contained in https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/artifact_signer/docs[the Ansible collection you will use^] will install and configure the components of RHTAS to run on a single RHEL server, which uses a standalone containerized deployment. A Kubernetes-based manifest creates Kubernetes manifests for the containers and are deployed using `podman kube play`. This playbook will give you a basic signing framework, and enable various day-1 and day-2 operations using it going forward. Specifically, the playbook supports:

* *Installation* of RHTAS on a single RHEL node
* *Backup/Restore of TAS signing data* (protects the signing data of your software supply chain, critical when there is data loss due to hardware failure or accidental data deletion.)
* *Refreshing TUF metadata* (helping to maintain a secure coding environment for developers and prevent mix-and-match attacks on a code base).
* *Certificate and key rotation* for Rekor, Certificate Transparency, Fulcio, and Timestamp Authority services (rotating these keys regularly can help prevent key tampering and theft.)

=== Components of RHTAS

The RHTAS Ansible collection deploys the following RHTAS components onto the `rhtas` machine:

* https://github.com/sigstore/rekor[Rekor^] - An immutable, tamper-evident transparency log for storing and verifying software supply chain metadata.
** Trillian database - A Merkle tree–backed data store that underpins Rekor’s transparency log.
** Optional: A self-managed MariaDB instance (for durable SQL storage), and a Redis instance(caching and service management) (both highly recommended for production deployments to simplify operations and offload service management, including data backup and restoration).
* https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio[Fulcio^] - A certificate authority that issues short-lived code-signing certificates tied to an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity.
* Certificate Log - A transparency log that records issued certificates for auditability and trust verification.
* Timestamp Authority - A service that provides trusted cryptographic timestamps to prove when data or signatures existed.
* The Update Framework (TUF) server - A secure distribution system that manages and delivers software updates with integrity and resilience against compromise.
* An https://www.nginx.com/[NGINX^] front end places an entrypoint to the various backend components. A set of self-signed certificates get generated at runtime to establishing secure communications to the following hosts:
+
** `https://cli-server.{base_hostname}`
** `https://fulcio.{base_hostname}`
** `https://rekor.{base_hostname}`
** `https://rekor-search.{base_hostname}`
** `https://tsa.{base_hostname}`
** `https://tuf.{base_hostname}`

Each RHTAS release is associated with and installs specific versions of the above components. For more detail on these dependencies, visit the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_trusted_artifact_signer/1.2/html/release_notes/appendix_a_red_hat_trusted_artifact_signer_release_notes[Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer Release Notes^].

The following steps will take you through the installation and configuration of RHTAS on RHEL. Not all configuration possibilities are covered in this module, but you can find more information in the https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/artifact_signer/docs/[RHTAS Ansible collection documentation^].

== Install Trusted Artifact Signer

=== Setup Environment Variables

. Copy and paste (you can click the small icon to the right of the command to copy, and then kbd:[CTRL-V] or kbd:[CMD-V] on MacOS to paste) into the terminal and press kbd:[ENTER] to run the command and assign the necessary environment variables:
+
[source,bash,role="execute", subs="+attributes"]
----
export GUID={guid}
export BASE_HOSTNAME={base_hostname}
export KEYCLOAK_REALM=trusted-artifact-signer
export KEYCLOAK_URL=https://rhbk.$BASE_HOSTNAME
export TUF_URL=https://tuf.$BASE_HOSTNAME
export OIDC_ISSUER_URL=$KEYCLOAK_URL/realms/$KEYCLOAK_REALM
export COSIGN_FULCIO_URL=https://fulcio.$BASE_HOSTNAME
export COSIGN_REKOR_URL=https://rekor.$BASE_HOSTNAME
export COSIGN_MIRROR=$TUF_URL
export COSIGN_ROOT=$TUF_URL/root.json
export COSIGN_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=$KEYCLOAK_REALM
export COSIGN_OIDC_ISSUER=$OIDC_ISSUER_URL
export COSIGN_CERTIFICATE_OIDC_ISSUER=$OIDC_ISSUER_URL
export COSIGN_YES="true"
export SIGSTORE_FULCIO_URL=$COSIGN_FULCIO_URL
export SIGSTORE_OIDC_ISSUER=$COSIGN_OIDC_ISSUER
export SIGSTORE_REKOR_URL=$COSIGN_REKOR_URL
export REKOR_REKOR_SERVER=$COSIGN_REKOR_URL
export CLI_SERVER_URL=https://cli-server.$BASE_HOSTNAME
----
+
These environment variables define the various endpoints and configuration for the RHTAS service, and are read from the CLI commands you'll run later in the module.

. Next, run these two commands, replacing the username and password or service account token with your own (don't just copy-paste, you'll need to replace the placeholders with your own values):
+
[source,bash]
----
export REGISTRY_USERNAME='<your username>'
export REGISTRY_PASSWORD='<your password or service account token>'
----

. To verify that your credentials are correct, attempt to login to the registry using `podman login`:
+
[source,bash, role="execute"]
----
podman login registry.redhat.io -u "$REGISTRY_USERNAME" -p "$REGISTRY_PASSWORD"
----
+
You should see `Login Succeeded!` indicating that you are logged in. If you get an error, confirm that your credentials are correct and that you have the correct permissions to access the registry.

=== Create Ansible Variables

. Create the Ansible variables file which will be used by the playbook when installing RHTAS.
+
[source,bash, role="execute", subs="+attributes"]
----
cat << EOF > ~/rhtas_vars.yml
# Hostname
tas_single_node_base_hostname: "{base_hostname}" # <1>

      {{ lookup('file', tas_ingress_certificate_key_file) }}
  cli-server:
    certificate: |
      {{ lookup('file', tas_ingress_certificate_cert_file) }}
    private_key: |
      {{ lookup('file', tas_ingress_certificate_key_file) }}

# System Packages
tas_single_node_system_packages:
  - podman
  - firewalld
EOF
----
<1> The base host name of the managed node. This generates self-signed certificates for the individual HTTPS endpoints.
<2> Note that these certificates are signed by a legitimate certificate authority. They are not "self-signed".
<3> This uses the pre-installed Keycloak instance as the OpenID Connect provider.

=== Create Ansible Playbook

. Create the Ansible playbook which is the main entry point for installation.
+
[source,bash, role="execute"]
----
cat << EOF > ~/install_rhtas.yml
---
- name: Install RHTAS
  hosts: rhtas
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Include Vars
      ansible.builtin.include_vars:
        file: rhtas_vars.yml
    - name: Call tas_single_node role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: redhat.artifact_signer.tas_single_node
...
EOF
----

=== Create Inventory File

. Create the inventory file which defines the hostnames of the managed nodes. We'll use the `rhtas` hostname for this exercise, and `rhtpa` for a later exercise.
+
[source,bash, role="execute"]
----
cat << EOF > ~/inventory 
[rhtas]
rhtas

[rhtpa]
rhtpa

[all:vars]
ansible_user=lab-user
EOF
----

=== Run Playbook to install RHTAS

You should have the following files in the `~/` directory (run `ls -l ~/` to confirm):

* `install_rhtas.yml` - The Ansible playbook to install RHTAS
* `inventory` - The inventory file to use specifying which hosts to use
* `privkey.pem` - The private key for the TLS certificates
* `rhtas_vars.yml` - The Ansible variables file to use with RHTAS configuration
* `root.pem` - The root TLS signed certificate
* `server.pem` - The server certificate 

If you do not have these files, please go back and review the previous steps. If you do have the files, you can continue with the next step.

. Run the following command to install RHTAS.
+
[source,bash, role="execute"]
----
cd ~ && \
ansible-navigator \# <1>
  -m stdout \# <2>
  --eei=localhost/ansible_ee \# <3>
  --pp=missing \# <4>
  run install_rhtas.yml \# <5>
  --pae=false \# <6>
  -i inventory# <7>
----
<1> Ansible Navigator is used to enable running the playbook in the specific execution environment (which `ansible-playbook` cannot do).
<2> Displays the output of the playbook in the terminal.
<3> The specific execution environment in which the playbook runs and contains the required Ansible Collections for the products.
<4> Only pull the execution environment if not already present locally (which it is))
<5> The playbook to run.
<6> Don't create playbook artifacts (like JSON log files)
<7> The inventory file to use
+
The installation will take several minutes to complete. Wait for it to finish before moving on! It should end with:

[source,console]
----
PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************************
rhtas                      : ok=262  changed=114  unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=233  rescued=0    ignored=0   
----
+
If you see any errors, scroll up and check for errors in the output. Confirm the files exist in the `/home/lab-user` directory correctly and appear correct.

To see the running services on the `rhtas` node, run the following command:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
ssh rhtas sudo "podman pod ps --filter status=running"
----

This will run the `podman pod ps` command on the `rhtas` node. You should see a number of pods for each of the services that were installed for RHTAS, including `rekor`, `rekor-search`, `fulcio`, `tuf`, `ctlog`, `cli-server`, `trillian`, and `nginx`. To see the log files for the `rekor` service, run the following command:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
ssh rhtas "sudo podman pod logs -f rekor-server-pod"
----

Press kbd:[CTRL-C] (or kbd:[CMD-C] on MacOS) to exit the log output. This can be useful for debugging issues with the RHTAS installation.

== Verify Trusted Artifact Signer installation

After installation and configuration, you can verify that Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer (RHTAS) is working correctly by signing and verifying test artifacts. This section covers signing and verifying test artifacts using the following methods: *Cosign* for container images, *Gitsign* for Git commits, and *Conforma (formerly known as Enterprise Contract)* for policy validation. You can use any or all of these methods in your own CI pipelines to sign and verify artifacts before they are deployed to production.

=== Method 1: Container Image Signing and Verification with `cosign`

`cosign` allows you to sign and verify Open Container Initiative (OCI) container images using RHTAS.

. Download the cosign binary from the CLI server:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
curl -L $CLI_SERVER_URL/clients/linux/cosign-amd64.gz | gunzip > cosign 
sudo chmod +x cosign && sudo mv cosign /usr/local/bin/cosign
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The CLI server also has a https://cli-server.{base_hostname}[web interface^] for downloading binaries for all of the tools used with RHTAS for various platforms. In this exercise we are using `curl` to download the binaries, but you can also use the web interface to download the binaries to your local workstation.
====

. Initialize cosign:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
curl -LO $COSIGN_ROOT # <1>
cosign initialize --root-checksum=$(sha256sum root.json | cut -d' ' -f1) # <2>
----
<1> Downloads the known-good `root.json` file (containing the trusted certificate and key targets) from the local TUF server.
<2> Initialize cosign to prepare for signing and verification later on using the known-good TUF root.

. Create a container image to sign using `podman`:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
echo "FROM scratch" > ./tmp.Dockerfile
podman build . -f ./tmp.Dockerfile -t ttl.sh/rhtas/test-image-$GUID:1h
rm ./tmp.Dockerfile
----

. Push the image to a registry:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
podman push ttl.sh/rhtas/test-image-$GUID:1h
----

. Sign the container image:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
cosign sign -y ttl.sh/rhtas/test-image-$GUID:1h
----
+
By using the `-y` option you are agreeing to the terms and conditions of the signature system based on sigstore and avoiding an interactive prompt.
+
IF you were running this on your local workstation, a web browser would open and ask you to login with your Keycloak credentials. In this environment, that's not possible, so you'll see an `xdg-open` error, and then a long link in the terminal:
+
image::rhtas-url-login.png[]
+
Copy and paste the link into a web browser (or just click on it if possible) to login to the pre-configured OIDC (Keycloak) server with your credentials:
+
* Username: `{rhtas_user1_username}`
* Password: `{rhtas_user1_password}`
+
image::rhtas-url-login2.png[]
+
Copy/paste the resulting code back into the terminal to complete the signing process:
+
image::rhtas-url-login3.png[]
+
image::rhtas-url-login4.png[]
+
[NOTE]
====
If you wait too long during this process, the short-lived authentication session and certificate will expire, and you may get timeout / deadline exceeded errors. Simply repeat the signing command.
====
+
This solution is known as https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/overview/[keyless signing^] and is a recommended practice for signing container images, as it does not rely on long-lived certs and keys that could become compromised. A short-lived certificate is generated (from Fulcio) for each signature, attached to the artifact (container), and is only valid for the duration of the signature, and can be later verified against the Rekor transparency log.

. Verify the signed container image:
+
Based on the Keycloak user that was used to sign the image, their email address was added as an identity within the signature. This vales can be used to verify the signature of the image. The email address takes the form of `<username>@redhat.com`. So if `chris` signed the image, the email address would be `chris@redhat.com`.
+
Set the email address in an environment variable:
+
[source,bash,role="execute", subs="+attributes"]
----
export EMAIL_ADDRESS="chris@redhat.com"
----
+
Now verify the image
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
cosign verify --certificate-identity=$EMAIL_ADDRESS ttl.sh/rhtas/test-image-$GUID:1h | jq
----
+
To verify, Cosign queries the transparency log (Rekor) to compare the public key bound to the certificate, and checks the timestamp on the signature against the artifact's entry in the transparency log. The signature is valid if its timestamp falls within the small window of time that the key pair and certificate issued by the certificate authority were valid.
+
If successful, you should see the following output (at the start, before the JSON representation of the signature):
+
[source,console]
----
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates
----
+
Along with the JSON representation of the signature.

. Now lets query the transparency log by using the Rekor command-line interface. Download the rekor-cli binary from the CLI server:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
curl -L $CLI_SERVER_URL/clients/linux/rekor-cli-amd64.gz | gunzip > rekor-cli 
sudo chmod +x rekor-cli && sudo mv rekor-cli /usr/local/bin/rekor-cli
----
+

. Search by log index:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
rekor-cli get --log-index 0 --rekor_server $COSIGN_REKOR_URL --format json | jq
----
+
You should see the JSON representation of the first entry in the log, containing the submitted artifact (your container image), and the inclusion proof and signed timestamp, which can be used to verify consistency and integrity of the artifact.

. Search for an email address to get the universal unique identifier (UUID):
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
rekor-cli search --email $EMAIL_ADDRESS --rekor_server $COSIGN_REKOR_URL --format json | jq
----
This command returns the UUID of any log entries that match the email address (you should see only one, but if you repeated the singing process you'd see two). This UUID can be used to get the transaction details.

. Get transaction details by UUID (replace `<UUID>` with the UUID you got from the previous step):
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
rekor-cli get --uuid $UUID --rekor_server $COSIGN_REKOR_URL --format json | jq
----
You will get the same entry as before.

These methods (and others) can be used in CI pipelines to verify the authenticity of the artifacts during build, promotion, and deployment.

=== Method 2: Git Commit Signing and Verification with Gitsign

Gitsign enables signing and verification of Git repository commits using RHTAS. Gitsign implements keyless signing to sign Git commits with a valid OpenID Connect identity (in this case coming from Keycloak). Signing details will then be stored in the transparency log (Rekor) for subsequent verification.

==== Download and Install Gitsign

. Download the gitsign binary from the CLI server web page:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
curl -L $CLI_SERVER_URL/clients/linux/gitsign-amd64.gz | gunzip > gitsign 
sudo chmod +x gitsign && sudo mv gitsign /usr/local/bin/gitsign
----

. Make a temporary Git repository and configure Git to use gitsign for commit signing:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
rm -rf ~/tmp-git-repo && mkdir -p ~/tmp-git-repo && cd ~/tmp-git-repo
git init
git config --local commit.gpgsign true # sign all commits
git config --local tag.gpgsign true # sign all tags
git config --local gpg.x509.program gitsign # use gitsign for signing
git config --local gpg.format x509 # use x509 format for signing
git config --local gitsign.fulcio $SIGSTORE_FULCIO_URL # use our Fulcio instance
git config --local gitsign.rekor $SIGSTORE_REKOR_URL # use our Rekor instance
git config --local gitsign.issuer $SIGSTORE_OIDC_ISSUER # use our OIDC provider
git config --local gitsign.clientID trusted-artifact-signer # OIDC client name
----

. Make a test commit and sign it:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
git commit --allow-empty -S -m "Test of a signed commit"
----
+
The same process should be followed as before. Copy the code from the web browser into the terminal to complete the commit process and sign the commit. You should seE:
+
[source,console]
----
tlog entry created with index: 2
[master (root-commit) 615b060] Test of a signed commit
 Committer: Red Hat Demo Platform Student <lab-user@bastion.lab.sandbox-7cx24-multi-cloud-base-infra.svc.cluster.local>
----

. Verify the commit:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
gitsign verify --certificate-identity=$EMAIL_ADDRESS --certificate-oidc-issuer=$SIGSTORE_OIDC_ISSUER HEAD
----
+
This extracts the signature attached to the commit, verifies it against the certificate issued during the signing process, confirms the certificate chain is valid against the known good trusted root, and that the signing certificate was recorded in Rekor, and that the OIDC identity matches what's expected.
+
You should see:
+
[source,console]
----
tlog index: 2
gitsign: Signature made using certificate ID 0xfd13bcafe1b0c9fed3d0df3345beb7ec192c94af | 
gitsign: Good signature from [chris@redhat.com](https://rhbk.7cx24.apps.ocpv04.rhdp.net/realms/trusted-artifact-signer)
Validated Git signature: true
Validated Rekor entry: true
Validated Certificate claims: true
----
+
Note the `Good signature` and Validation confirmations indicating that the signature is valid on the commit.

=== Method 3: Policy Validation with Conforma (Enterprise Contract)

The first two methods explored above verify the authenticity of the artifact (container image or Git commit) using the signature and attestation. Conforma takes it a step further by verifying the artifact against a set of policies.

Conforma, formally known as Enterprise Contract (EC), is a tool for maintaining the security of software supply chains, and you can use it to define and enforce policies for container images. You can use the `ec` binary to verify the attestation(verifiable claims about any aspect of how a piece of software is produced) and signature of container images that use Red Hat's Trusted Artifact Signer (RHTAS) signing framework. This is typically used in CI pipelines during container image promotion and deployment. Conforma policies are defined using the https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/policy-language[rego policy language^]. 

. Download the ec binary from the CLI server:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
curl -L $CLI_SERVER_URL/clients/linux/ec-amd64.gz | gunzip > ec-amd64 
sudo chmod +x ec-amd64 && sudo mv ec-amd64 /usr/local/bin/ec
----

. Create a `predicate.json` file for SLSA provenance (Refer to the https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance[SLSA provenance predicate specifications^] for more information about the schema layout):
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
cat << EOF > ~/predicate.json
{
  "builder": {
    "id": "https://localhost/dummy-id"
  },
  "buildType": "https://example.com/tekton-pipeline",
  "invocation": {},
  "buildConfig": {},
  "metadata": {
    "completeness": {
      "parameters": false,
      "environment": false,
      "materials": false
    },
    "reproducible": false
  },
  "materials": []
}
EOF
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This file is just an example with dummy data. In a real-world scenario, you would use the actual data from the build of the container image, including a real builder ID, links to source repos, dependencies in `materials`, and how it was built (in the `invocation` and `buildConfig` fields).
====

. Attach the `predicate.json` file to the test image:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
cosign attest -y --predicate ~/predicate.json --type slsaprovenance ttl.sh/rhtas/test-image-$GUID:1h
----
+
The same process should be followed as before. Copy the code from the web browser into the terminal to complete the attestation process. You should see:
+
[source,console]
----
tlog entry created with index: xxxx
----
+
This makes a record in the transparency log (Rekor) for the attestation. The attestation in this case is the SLSA provenance attestation, recording who built it, what source repo, which builder, what commands, what dependencies, etc.

. Verify the image has at least one attestation and signature:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
cosign tree ttl.sh/rhtas/test-image-$GUID:1h
----
+
This outputs any attached attestation and signature for the image. You should see something like this (at least 1 attestation and 1 signature):
+
[source,console]
----

. https://conforma.dev/docs/cli/ec_validate_image.html[Validate conformance^] of container images with the provided policies:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
ec validate image --image ttl.sh/rhtas/test-image-$GUID:1h --certificate-identity $EMAIL_ADDRESS --certificate-oidc-issuer $OIDC_ISSUER_URL --output yaml --show-successes
----

Conforma generates a pass-fail report with details on any security violations. When you add the `--info` flag, the report includes more details and possible solutions for any violations found.

If all verification steps complete successfully, your RHTAS installation is working correctly and ready for production use.

[NOTE]
====
Without specifying a policy, Conforma just does the minimal integrity checks and calls it a day. In practice, organizations would typically define policies to check against, and use Conforma to validate the artifacts against those policies. For example, the Conforma project has some https://conforma.dev/docs/policy/index.html[pre-defined policy definitions^] for common security best practices that organizations can start with, and it is designed to be extensible to allow for organizations to define their own policies. You can see how our dummy data fares against these policies (using `@minimal`) by running 

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
ec validate image --image ttl.sh/rhtas/test-image-$GUID:1h --certificate-identity $EMAIL_ADDRESS --certificate-oidc-issuer $OIDC_ISSUER_URL --output yaml --show-successes --policy '{
    "configuration": { "include": ["@minimal"] },
    "sources": [
      {
        "policy": ["oci::quay.io/enterprise-contract/ec-release-policy:latest"],
        "data":   ["oci::quay.io/enterprise-contract/ec-policy-data:latest"]
      }
    ]
  }'  
----
Here you can see a number of _violations_ in the output indicating our dummy data failed the policy checks.

== Next Steps

With Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer installed and configured, you can now:

* Sign software artifacts
* Verify artifact integrity
* Integrate with your CI/CD pipelines
* Configure policy-based signing workflows

=== CI/CD Integration with RHADS Components

RHTAS integrates seamlessly with other Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite components to create comprehensive CI/CD workflows. For example, you can use Red Hat Developer Hub templates to create project scaffolds that automatically include container image signing via `cosign` and Git commit signing via `gitsign` in their CI pipelines. Using Conforma's policy validation, you can enforce security gates that verify artifact signatures, SBOMs and attestations before promoting images to production environments. This creates a cohesive developer experience where all artifacts are cryptographically signed, provenance is tracked through SLSA attestations, and policies ensure compliance before deployment.

For more advanced configuration options and day-2 operation capabilities on RHEL, refer to the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_trusted_artifact_signer[official Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer documentation^].
